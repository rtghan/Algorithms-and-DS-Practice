A collection of the various algorithm/data structure problems I have solved on dmoj.ca, including topics such as segment trees/disjoint sets, graph theory, recursion, and dynamic programming. 

In terms of difficulty, I am most proud of 'Mock CCC '18 Contest 2 S5 - A Link/Cut Tree Problem', 'Segment Tree Test', and 'CCC '03 S5 - Trucking Troubles', though these solutions were all written quite a while ago.
